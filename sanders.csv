"It is not bad or harmful for the federal government to provide assistance to those in need. We need more compassion in government, not less."
The United States has the ability to create millions of good paying jobs by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels.
We cannot allow our great nation to be hijacked by right-wing billionaires like the Koch brothers. We must fight back.
It's unacceptable that while wealthy corporations are doing phenomenally well the middle class is collapsing and poverty is increasing.
Everyone understands what our disastrous trade agreements are all about. They're written by corporate CEOs to benefit corporate CEOs.

Our economy cannot become vibrant or sustainable when the middle class is disappearing and working families lack disposable income.
It doesn't make much economic sense for us to pay twice as much for health care per capita as other nations that provide universal coverage.
"It’s not just planes, tanks and guns that are a cost of war. The cost of war is taking care of those people who were injured in that war."

"If we are serious about protecting the planet and improving our economy, America must focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy."
We need to fundamentally change the way Wall Street does business. We should not risk our economy on casino-style gambling.
"We must do away with the corporate loopholes that currently exist, which enable corporations to pay next to nothing in federal taxes."
There is no reason the United States must maintain a bloated military budget which spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined.
It is important that the American people stand together and end bigotry.
It's absurd that over the past decade the net worth of the top 400 billionaires in this country has doubled to an astronomical $1 trillion.

"We've had enough environmental disasters to learn by now that there must be no new offshore drilling. Not now, not ever. #KeepItInTheGround"
"We have got to fundamentally rewrite our trade policy laws so that American products, not jobs, are our number one export."
Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is incomprehensible.
"Offshore drilling does not achieve the goals its advocates claim and is not worth the risk. Time to move away from oil, not drill for more."
"If our democracy is to survive, we need to make this clear: our elections are not, and must never be, for sale to the highest bidder."
"Between you and me, and everyone else in America, corporations are not people. They don't get a vote and shouldn't be able to buy elections."
"We must ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share into Social Security by lifting the income payroll tax to $250,000."
My advice for climate change deniers in Congress is to worry more about their children's future and less about their campaign contributors.
Our political system by and large is owned and controlled by big money interests.
The Exxon Valdez oil spill cost up to $7 billion and the consequences persist today. The evidence is clear. We must keep it in the ground.

The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
"In a world of so much violence, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of that. We must abolish capital punishment."
Mexico's agricultural sector lost 1.3 million jobs in the 10 years after NAFTA. It was a lose-lose for working people both here and there.
"It's unacceptable that the richest 16,000 families in the U.S. now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."

A bank that's too big to fail is also big enough to buy elections. Big banks endanger both our economic security and our democratic values.
We're spending $80 billion a year locking up people. Nobody thinks that that makes sense.
The offshore tax haven network isn’t something that we need to reform or refine. It’s a form of legalized tax fraud that must end.
Bottom line is no single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure would send the world economy into crisis.
"It is too late for establishment politics. The problems facing this country are so serious that the same-old, same-old ain't going to do it."
"If college could be tuition free 50 years ago, I don't know why the hell we can't do it today."
If the United States is serious about moving toward energy independence in a cost-effective way then we should invest in solar energy.
We must not take Social Security for granted especially since the program provides dignity and security to millions of Americans every day.
I believe the function of banking should not be about making as much profits as possible but rather ensuring affordable loans for Americans.
It's not a radical idea to price fossil fuels and their effects on our communities in the form of a carbon tax.
Congress must ensure that the greed and recklessness of Wall Street can never destroy the livelihood of everyday Americans ever again.
"Dr. King told us: You judge people on their character, not on the color of their skin. And I'd add not on their gender or sexual orientation"
Let us never forget that the reckless behavior on Wall Street plunged the US into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
Congress must catch up with the scientific community and the rest of the country by acknowledging the severity of the climate change crisis.
"It’s outrageous that as the rich become much richer, the level of income and wealth inequality has reached obscene and unimaginable levels."
"No one in America in should ever have to choose between their medicine and their food, and yet millions have to make that choice every day."
Creating smaller banks will lead to more competition within the financial services industry and better interest rates for American consumers
We cannot continually allow the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet with impunity while reaping enormous profits. This must end.
Let me be as blunt as I can: The American political system has been totally corrupted by big money.
My entire political career has been dedicated to the conviction that all Americans are entitled to live lives of decency and dignity.
How do we make the American dream a reality again? We can start by making college tuition free so every American can get an education.
"Corporations should not be able to buy their own tax rate with lobbyists. In a democratic society, everyone must pay their fair share."
There is something massively wrong when the 62 richest folks in the world own more wealth than the bottom 3.5 billion.
The middle class in America is angry because for decades their wages have stagnated while the rich got richer.  That must change.
"Every working person in the United States should have a chance at a decent life through guaranteed paid medical, family and sick leave."
"It's appalling that nearly half of Americans have less than $10,000 in savings and no idea how they will be able to retire with dignity."
The biggest banks spent over $20 million on lobbying every year. It would be naive to suggest they aren't expecting anything in return.
"All the time, I see billionaires pushing policies that make themselves richer and others poorer. That’s not what human life should be about."
The challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial. Our challenge is mostly a moral one.

Just 50 people give 41% of super PAC donations. Citizens United has given a few ultra-wealthy people unprecedented power over our democracy.
Transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels will not only protect the environment but create good-paying jobs.
"When your kid gets sick, you should know that you can take them to the doctor. Do you know what kind of load that is off parents' shoulders?"
"As a nation built by immigrants, we must strive for humane immigration policies that unify families, not tear them apart. #FightForFamilies"
The reality is that for 40 years there’s been an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle class and poor to the rich.
The U.S. can create the necessary revenue needed to create millions of jobs to rebuild our infrastructure by closing corporate tax loopholes
"Maybe before we demand cuts to Social Security, we should end the blatant outrage of offshore tax havens that cost us $100 billion per year."
"We can create million of jobs and fight climate change by transforming our energy system away from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy."
"Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, deregulation and Reaganomics have left us with an economy operated by and for the top 1%."
"When labeling genetically modified food is required in 64 countries around the world, why is it not required in the United States?"
It's insane people work two or three jobs just to cobble together enough income and some health care benefits to survive. This must end.
Forcing parents of a newborn baby to go back to work days after their kid is born is not a family value. We must guarantee paid family leave
It's grossly unfair that interest rates on student loans are two to three times higher than on auto loans.
"When we reform campaign finance, we create a more efficient Congress whose members will no longer need to spend half their time fundraising."
"The US has got to join every other major industrialized country and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege."
Campaign finance isn't an arcane debate. It has real effects on each working person whose interests are disregarded for big donors.
"In a democracy, spending millions of dollars on lobbyists should not be the most profitable investment that a corporation can make."
"I’m pleased the president signed an extension of the Older Americans Act into law today. In this rich nation, no senior should go hungry."
"It's ludicrous that Morgan Stanley paid nothing in federal income taxes last year, but received $604 million refund from the IRS."
"It is high time we understood that we have to invest in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration."
It is absolutely vital that we act boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels. #KeepItInTheGround. https://t.co/X8LEii0QQ5
"Our vision for democracy should be one in which politicians are improving the lives of every day Americans, not just wealthy billionaires."
The 12.2% rise in drug spending last year was due in large part to price hikes on existing medication. Big drug companies are ripping us off
What message are we sending kids from poor and middle-class families by saddling them with insurmountable debt for getting an education?
"Despite living in the most technologically advanced economy in human history, Americans are still worker longer hours for lower wages."
"It's insane that while McDonald's has opposed an $15 an hour minimum wage for its employees, its CEO received a 368% raise last year."
"If we're serious about reducing income inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we must increase the number of union jobs in this country"
"We need to make certain every kid in this country, regardless of income, can go to college and leave school without crushing financial debt."
It makes no sense to me that CEOs can see their salaries increase by 1000% over 36 years while workers make starvation wages of $7.25/hour.
"Big, powerful donors are so invested in the status quo that we aren't going to change America unless millions of us fight for that change."
We must recognize that allowing all qualified students to achieve a higher education is an investment in our nation's economic prosperity.
"Change always happens when millions of people demand it. When the American people stand up and fight, they win.

"I didn't hear folks in Congress calling wealth redistribution ""radical"" as $1 trillion got transferred from the middle class to the top 1%."
"Why is it that only we can't have universal health care? If Germany, if Scandinavia, if every major country does it, then we can do it."
